# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is a version control system that helps track changes in files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. 
# GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for collaboration, sharing, and management of code. 
# Git Bash is a command line interface for Windows that provides a Unix-like environment and allows users to run Git commands.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# the terminal is a program that provides a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system, 
# while the command line is the actual interface where users type commands to perform various tasks.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Windows PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, 
# while Git Bash is a command line interface that provides a Unix-like environment for running Git commands on Windows.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science,
# conda is a package manager that comes with Anaconda and helps manage packages and environments,
# and Python is a high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft that supports various programming languages and provides features like debugging, version control, and extensions.
#it is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for writing, editing, and managing code.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
# Jupyter Lab is an extension of Jupyter Notebook that provides a more flexible and powerful interface for working with notebooks, code, and data.


# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# ~/ is a shorthand notation for the home directory of the current user in Unix-like operating systems.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path is a complete path that specifies the location of a file or directory from the root directory,
# while a relative path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute path: /Users/maddyszanto/Downloads/pythondecal/maddyszanto/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative path: course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# It would remove the current directory, but since the current directory is not a file, it would likely result in an error.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add 
# git add adds changes in the working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed to the repository.
# git commit
# git commit records the changes in the staging area to the repository, creating a new commit with a unique identifier.
# git push
# git push uploads the local commits to a remote repository, allowing others to access the changes.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories to the staging area,
# while git add <file> adds only the specified file to the staging area.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status shows the current status of the working directory and staging area, including any changes that have been made but not yet committed.
# git log -1 shows the most recent commit in the repository, including its unique identifier, author, date, and commit message.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning a repository creates a local copy of the entire repository on your machine,
# while pulling from a repository updates your local copy with the latest changes from the remote repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#At first I had to set up git and push my files over and I joined a bit late so I still have some catching up to do.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#I feel pretty good so far! but I am still a bit confused about the different git hub types and commands

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# I'm pretty new to python but know some basics, and I have been using matplotlib for summer research and homework but need some help!!

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print( 81 % 8 ) # this gives the remainder of 81 divided by 8 which is 1
